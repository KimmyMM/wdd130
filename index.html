        <p>  Hi there! I am Kimberly from the Philippines. This semester, I'm excited to start my first certificate course in Web Programming, which is different from my job as a Research Assistant. I'm interested in this course because of the job opportunities it offers in the corporate world. Plus, I find the coursework challenging.  </p>

        <p>El Nido is situated on the northernmost tip of Palawan Island, in Bacuit Bay. This is one of the major tourist destinations of Palawan. It comprises around 45 islands & islets. There are also hundreds of limestone cliffs, which form a karst backdrop quite similar to those found in the popular Halong Bay in Vietnam and Krabi in Thailand. It is no surprise that El Nido is ranked #4 in the list of “20 Most Beautiful Beaches in the World” by Conde Nast Traveler website. The main language of El Nido is Filipino. Many locals can also speak English fluently. Fishing, agriculture and tourism are the main industries of El Nido. This area also owns many famous spots for diving (Asia Tours).</p>
